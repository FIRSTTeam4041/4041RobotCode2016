This is the Robot Code for The 2016 FIRST Team 4041 Robot "Sir Lancebot". 
This code is a Java project for Eclipse, so to implement the laest chanes, 
create an Eclipse Project called RobotCode, 
then downlaad the folder
and insert it into your Eclipse workspace folder.
Eclipse will then go into panic mode for a bit, then the code will be updated.
